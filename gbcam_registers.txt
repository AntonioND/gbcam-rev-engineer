BIT(0) - Start(W)/Working(R)
BIT(1) - ???(W/R)
BIT(2) - ???(W/R)
BIT(3-7) - Unused?

A002, A003
----------

Exposure time (2 MSB, 3 LSB)
They correspond to regs C0 and C1 of M64282FP - Exposure time (each step is 16 us)
u16 exposure_time = reg[3] | (reg[2]<<8);

At boot is written (in hex):

    80
    BF A0 B0 B8 BC BE BF BF
    3F
    BF A0 B0 B8 BC BE BF BF
    BF A0 B0 B8 BC BE BF BF
    BF A0 B0 B8 BC BE BF BF
    BF A0 B0 B8 BC BE BF BF
    BF A0 B0 B8 BC BE BF BF
    80
    BF A0 B0 B8 BC BE BF BF
    3F
    BF -- and stays like that forever (sometimes writes BF again?)

This corresponds to this register of M64282FP:

    No. Address   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
    1   001       N  VH1 VH0 G4  G3  G2  G1  G0

    Symbol   Bit Assignment  Operation
    N        1 bit           Exclusively set vertical edge enhancement mode (?)
    VH       2 bits          Select vertical - horizontal edge operation mode (?)
    G        5 bits          Analog output gain

    It enables and disables "N" register.
    VH1 is never set.
    G register changes between values 0, 10, 18, 1C, 1E, 1F.

At the end:

    N  = 1  - Vertical edge enhancement mode. 
              Access to P and M registers is always ignored!!!!
    VH = 01 - Horizontal edge mode.
    G  = 1F - Total Gain (dB) = 57.5 dB

N and VH seems to have conflicting values.
Maybe this GB Camera register corresponds to another one, or this one but
modifying the values... Anyway, emulate 2D edge enhancement.

A006-A035
---------

Dithering/contrast matrix (48 registers). 48/3 = 16 = 4x4 matrix of 3 elements.
